What was once simply my personal website has devolved into a Ukulele chord diagramming website, assembled over a little under a week. I was disappointed at other chord website's information on the various fingering positions for chords. What notes were being played? And more importantly, for jazz chords, what notes were being excluded? This attempts to fix these issues with a huge variety of chords and positions, listing information for obscure fingerings and obscure chords.

TO DO:
 - Add sound
 - Chord identification tool
 - Additional information for each chord (is it an inversion, did you leave out the fifth, etc.)
 - Make specific chord pages filterable (currently we remove all fingerings with muted strings--this could be an option instead. Similarly, we force limit the stretch size, which a large-handed player may wish to incease.)
 - Flash card tool
 - Refactor (obviously)
 - (pipe dream) use AI/other audio tools to see if we can recognize the notes/chord being played from a sound sample.
 - Fix broken pages (we need pages for chord types)
 - Fix appearance of easyscore
